## Hello!

# I'm Tomas, nice to meet you.

I am a passionate founder working at the intersection of technology and sustainable urbanism for over 15 years. My work focuses on solving critical problems facing communities around the world by building networks for local production and citizen empowerment. This has taken the form of pioneering digital fabrication laboratories, from the globally recognized Fab Lab Barcelona to launching new innovation hubs like Fab Lab Bali.
